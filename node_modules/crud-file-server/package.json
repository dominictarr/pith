This works for directories and files.\n\n**HEAD** is the same as a GET, omitting the body.\n\n**PUT** can be used to write a file.\n\n**DELETE** can be used to delete a file or folder.\n\n**POST** supports two operations, rename and create directory.  \n\n**POST** http://localhost/newDir?create=directory would create a directory named newDir.  \n\n**POST** http://localhost/abc.html?rename=def.html would rename abc.html to def.html.\n\nRun the Example\n===============\n\nFor further clarification, try running the example.\n\n    npm install crud-file-server\n\nNavigate to the example directory (which should now be under node_modules/crud-file-server/example).\n\n\tcd node_modules/crud-file-server/example\n\nRun crud-file-server to host the current directory. \n\n    crud-file-server -p 3300\n    \t\nNow use your browser to navigate to http://localhost:3300/example.html.  \nYou will see a simple client that lets you interact with your file system from the web browser.\n",
